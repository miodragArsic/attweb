We're looking to bring a Senior iOS and/or Android developer into our smarty-pants family. We could fill this posting with a bunch of crap about how you should be a "rockstar" or a "code ninja", but f-that, most of us are engineers just like you, and those job postings make us cringe. What we will do is tell you who we are, and who we're looking for. No bullshit, no merge conflicts, just the facts.

ALLTHINGSTALK is a globally funded technology startup company building connected solutions for the rapidly growing 'Internet of Things' industry. Our core software component is .NET based, with many other components using the latest state-of-the-art technologies and frameworks.

We're 50% in Serbia, 50% in Belgium and we've worked hard to simplify our proceses to make collaboration and communication painless. All of our teams communicate primarily through Trello for issue tracking and planning and Google Hangouts for voice-calls, screen-sharing.

Do you love a simple, straight-forward process? Does shipping software that will impact millions of users excite you? Is writing fault tolerant, scalable software in objective-C or Java already getting you all hot and bothered? If that sounds like you, read on and definitely consider applying!

As part of ALLTHINGSTALK, you will:
build and maintain iOS and Android mobile client apps that relay on our web API system. manage the micro-services you've deployed into production
take a pragmatic approach to testing and test coverage
work with different languages, frameworks, and tools when necessary
give back to the community by managing and pushing forward our open source projects
A few more details
We don't care where you live, whether it's under the bridge, in your mom's basement, or out of a backpack as you travel the world - as long as you're an exceptional communicator and team player who has a proven record of shipping, it's all good.

Salary: 1000 - 1500 EUR/month

Perks & Benefits:

A brand new Macbook Air or Pro

Free Rdio Account
2 to 3 trips a year to hang and work with the team!

I'm ready to ship!

Awesome, we're excited to hear from you! To apply, send us an e-mail that includes your Full Name, a link to your LinkedIn or Resume, and anything else you'd like us to check out (GitHub profiles, open source projects, videos or anything you're proud of!). Once you've got all that together, send it to: JoinTheEngineeringTeam+FL@FetLife.com.

Bonus Question
You a keener? For extra points, we have an optional question that you can answer and include along with your application:

If we asked you to build an activity feed, how would you architect it? What are the strengths and weaknesses of your design?


Know the perfect person?
If you put the perfect person in contact with us and we hire them, we'll send you $2,000 (USD, CDN or Pesos) as a thank you.
