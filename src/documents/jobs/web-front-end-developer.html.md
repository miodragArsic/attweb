### NOTE: THIS POSTING SHOULD SUIT AS A TEMPLATE FOR NEW JOB POSTINGS

We're looking to bring a Senior iOS and/or Android developer into our smarty-pants family. We could fill this posting with a bunch of crap about how you should be a "rockstar" or a "code ninja", but f-that, most of us are engineers just like you, and those job postings make us cringe. What we will do is tell you who we are, and who we're looking for. No bullshit, no merge conflicts, just the facts.

ALLTHINGSTALK is a globally funded technology startup company building connected solutions for the rapidly growing 'Internet of Things' industry. Our core software component is .NET based, with many other components using the latest state-of-the-art technologies and frameworks.

We're 50% in Serbia, 50% in Belgium and we've worked hard to simplify our proceses to make collaboration and communication painless. Our team use Trello for tracking issues and planning.

Do you love a simple, straight-forward process? Does shipping software that will impact millions of users excite you? Is writing fault tolerant, scalable software in **Javascript and HTML5** already getting you all hot and bothered? If that sounds like you, read on and definitely consider applying!

### As part of ALLTHINGSTALK, you will:

- build and maintain iOS and Android mobile client apps that relay on our web API system. 
- manage the micro-services you've deployed into production
- take a pragmatic approach to testing and test coverage
- work with different languages, frameworks, and tools when necessary

### You absolutely need to excel in

- HTML5 and CSS3
- Javascript (at least the [The good parts of it](http://it-ebooks.info/book/274/))

### We expect that you can

- use [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to construct our web client app
- use [Require.js] and [Node.js] as dependencies 
- use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), a Node.js module to build web app files. Particular modules in use are: `gulp-angular-templates`, `gulp-concat`, `gulp-less`, `gulp-sourcemaps`, `gulp-uglifyjs`
- use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to keep our web app versioned
- use LESS to style our HTML like a pro

### Salary 

!!! <TBD>

### Perks & Benefits:

A brand new Macbook Air or Pro

### Bonus Question
You a keener? For extra points, we have an optional question that you can answer and include along with your application:

If we asked you to build an activity feed, how would you architect it? What are the strengths and weaknesses of your design?

### I'm ready to ship!

Awesome, we're excited to hear from you! To apply, send us an e-mail that includes your Full Name, a link to your LinkedIn or Resume, and anything else you'd like us to check out (GitHub or BitBucket profiles, open source projects, videos or anything you're proud of!). Once you've got all that together, send it to: np@allthingstalk.com.
